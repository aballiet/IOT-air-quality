# IOT-air-quality 

This project aims at creating a portable device that allows you to monitor air quality.

1. [Getting started ðŸš¦](<#Getting started ðŸš¦>)
1. [Automate with crontab ðŸ¤–](<#Automate with crontab ðŸ¤–>)

## Requirements ðŸ“œ
- Raspberry pi (3B model used)
- DHT11 sensor (3 pins model)
- 3 wires

## Getting started ðŸš¦

### Setup the project by running these commands on your raspberry

```bash
cd                          # go at your home directory
mkdir IOT && cd ./IOT       # create IOT directory and enter in it
sudo apt install git # Make sure that GIT is installed
git clone https://github.com/aballiet/IOT-air-quality.git
```

1. **[Setup your DHT11 sensor](./DHT11/README.md)**
1. Choose your Database platform 
    - **[Ready to use ThingSpeak](./ThingSpeak/README.md)** : no requirement
    - **[Setup a single ELK node](./ELK/README.md)** : requires a server instance


## Automate with crontab ðŸ¤–
Once everything is setup, you can automate the uploading/measuring task thanks to crontab.

```bash
crontab -e
```

Then add the following line
> Be careful if your username is different (here `pi`)
```bash
*/1 * * * * bash /home/pi/IOT/IOT-air-quality/cron_measure.sh
```

This specific part at the beginning : `*/1 * * * *` defines the refresh rate of the script. It corresponds to a measure/upload **each minute**. See [this](https://crontab.guru/) link to help you write your refresh rate.
